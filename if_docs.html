        <h1>IF-Space Engine Documentation</h1>
        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>The IF-Space Engine Software is designed to make creating works of interactive fiction easy, fun, and code free.  Three styles
        of interactive fiction are available for creation with this software:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Classic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Games which require the user to input strings of text to further the gameplay (like Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork)</li>
                <li>Utilizes: Entire range of node tools</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Modern</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Games which generate buttons for the possible in-game actions as well as the possible directions in which to move</li>
                <li>Utilizes: Node Tools Header, Directions, Descriptions, Actions, Win, Lose</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gamebook</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Games which only generate buttons for the possible directions in which to move (Like a choose your path gamebook)</li>
                <li>Utilizes: Node Tools Header, Directions, Descriptions, Win, Lose</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <details>
            <summary class="boldAccordion">HTML Markup in Textareas</summary>
            <span>It is never necessary, however if you would like to add bold, underline, italic, or line break
                functionality to a textarea (description text boxes), you can do so with these simple markup tags:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bold: &lt;b&gt;Your bold text here&lt;/b&gt;</li>
                    <li>Underline: &lt;u&gt;Your underlined text here&lt;/u&gt;</li>
                    <li>Italic: &lt;i&gt;Your italicized text here&lt;/i&gt;</li>
                    <li>Line break: &lt;br&gt;</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The line break is particularly useful for fromatting dialogue.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                Until Javascript and HTML5 can agree on a universal contentEditable feature across
                all browsers, this markup is the best that ifspace can do without risking the use of 
                deprecated features like execCommand.  Beyond this list of tags, any script and html tags 
                are stripped from the text upon saving the game.
            </span>
        </details>
        <h2><u>Layout</u></h2>
        <h3>Node Map</h3>
        <p>- Left hand side of the page, consisting of the grid space</p>
        <h3>Node Tools</h3>
        <p>- Right hand side of the page, consisting of the various tabs and options</p>
        <h3>Global Setings</h3>
        <p>- Box below the Node Map, consists of settings which apply to all nodes and/or at the start of a game</p>
        <h3>Game Sim</h3>
        <p>- Expandable lower section of the page (upon clicking 'Test Game'), consisting of the mock game play area</p>
        <h2><u>Functions</u></h2>
        <h3>Node Map</h3>
        <p>The grid space on the left side of the software is known as the 'Node Map'.  It is here where the "map" of your game is realized.</p>
        <p>The red colored square in the Node Map indicates the Node which you currently have selected and which would be edited if changes
        are made in the Node Tools.</p>
        <p>Blue colored squares indicate nodes which exist but that are not currently active in the Node Tools.
        To switch from the currently active node (the red one) to an inactive node, simply click whichever inactive node you would like to
        edit.</p>
        <p>Black colored squares (empty squares) are locations which are available to create a node.  To do this, simply click inside of
        an empty square which you would like to be a node, and then click "Ok" when you are asked if you are sure.</p>
        <p>To delete any given node and all of its contents, first select and make active the node that is to be deleted, and then click
        the "Delete Node" button in the top left.  You will then be prompted to click "Ok" or "Cancel" to make sure this was not a mistake.</p>
        <p>The zoom in and out functions can be found in the bottom bar of the software.  Clicking these will either enlarge or shrink the grid
        space, respective to the button you click.</p>
        <p>The z-index input is responsible for changing the z coordinate of the Node Map.  Although the Node Map is represented in a standard
        X,Y coordinate plane, the Z axis still exists and can be changed with the z-index input.  This is useful for games where the map is
        meant to maintaine the true form of the available directions and which contain Up or Down directions (which default to increasing or
        decreasing the z coordinate, respectively).  This particular feature can be ignored, but to ignore this feature while
        also including Up or Down directions in the game will require changing the destination location of those directions in the Directions
        tab (see Directions tab below for more information).</p>
        <h3>Node Tools</h3>
        <h4>Node Tools Header</h4>
        <p>The Node Tools Header can be thought of as the basic setup for each node.  It consists of the Location of the node, the given Name of
        the node, the default Visibility of the node, and the number of Points available for visiting this node.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The constant X,Y,Z coordinate of the currently selected node.  This cannot be changed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This field is for the Name of the current node.  This will be printed to the screen during gameplay each time the user
                visits this node.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Visibility</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Default value of this node's visibility</li>
                <li>Determines whether or not the potential items in this node will be available for pickup and printed onscreen when
                visiting the node and/or using the "Look" command.</li>
                <li>Checked means the items will be available, and unchecked means they will not be available or printed to screen</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Points</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of points the user will receive upon visiting this node for the first time.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions Tab</h4>
        <p>The Directions Tab is used to define the various directions in which a player can move from this node during gameplay.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Checkbox Directions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>By checking one of these boxes, you are adding the potential for a player to go in this direction during gameplay.</li>
                <li>After checking a box, the directions's additional options are displayed below the checkboxes.</li>
                <li>Unchecking a box will remove the potential for that direction during gameplay and will also erase any of the options for
                that direction that were changed while the box was checked.</li>
                <li>NOTE: The node in which this direction leads to is not automatically created (since the destination location can be
                edited).  You must create the node that this direction leads to manually in the Node Map.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Location Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Location Setting is the node location in which the player will be sent when successfully navigating in this direction
                during gameplay.</li>
                <li>The default Location Setting is the location on the Node Map which would naturally occur when moving from the currently
                selected node (the node being edited) one position in the checked direction being edited.</li>
                <li>This Location Setting can be changed to any node (in the form of x,y,z).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Alternatives Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Alternative names given to the checked directions which would also result in the player moving in the checked direction.  For
                example: On top of saying 'Go North', the user may naturally want to say 'Follow path' or 'Take path'.  The comma
                separated list in the 'Alternatives' field makes up all of the other potential means of going in the checked direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Exclude Defaults Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Checkbox for removing the possibility of using the default "Go {direction}" command.  For example, if the "North" direction
                is checked, and the 'Exclude Defaults' checkbox is checked, then the user cannot type "Go North" to go this direction; they must
                use one of the listed 'Alternatives' instead.</li>
                <li>By default, this checkbox is unchecked - therefore including the "Go {direction}" command in the available commands for moving
                in this direction.</li>
                <li>This setting is especially useful for Modern and Gamebook styles, since a singular Alternative to 'Go {direction}' is likely
                desired.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Requirements</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The requirements for this direction to be available for use by the player during gameplay</li>
                <li>See the 'Requirements' section below for more details on 'Requirements'.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Descriptions Tab</h4>
        <p>The Descriptions Tab is where a node's initial text (upon visiting the node in gameplay) is defined.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Default Setting</li>
            <ul>
                This is the text which will be printed during gameplay the first time the user visits this node.  Typically it would include any
                continued plot which is being told as well as any setting features which should be described to the player.
            </ul>
            <li>Basic Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the text which will be printed during gameplay upon subsequent visits to this node as well as after the "Look" command.
                Typically this includes any setting features which should be described to the player.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Evolutions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Evolution descriptions are printed during gameplay (in place of default and basic descriptions) when their requirements are
                met.</li>
                <li>A node may have any number of evolution descriptions, including zero.</li>
                <li>If many evolutions exist, the right most evolution description which meets its requirements will be the description that is
                printed to the screen when a player visits this node.</li>
                <li>See the 'Requirements' section below for more details on 'Requirements'.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Items Tab</h4>
        <p>The items tab is used to create and define the items which will start in this node.  Items are things in the game that the player
        can pick up, look at, and drop anywhere in the game.  Players can check which items are on their person by using the "Inventory" command.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add Item Button</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adds an item to the list of items which would begin in this node.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Remove Item Button</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Removes the item related to this particular button from the item list associated with this node.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Name Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This input is for a list of all the different possible names referring to this item.  For example: Flashlight, torch, light</li>
                <li>The first name in the list will be used for the onscreen referral to this item.</li>
                <li>Should be in the form of a comma separated list</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Description Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This description will be the output for when the player uses the "Look {item}" command.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Points</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of points the user will receive for having this item in their inventory.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Requirements</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The requirements for this item to be available for pickup by the player during gameplay</li>
                <li>See the 'Requirements' section below for more details on 'Requirements'.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add Evolution Button</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adds an evolution to this item</li>
                <li>Item evolutions can be used to change the description of an item given its set of requirements are satisified.</li>
                <li>Any number of evolutions can be added to an item.</li>
                <li>If multiple item evolutions exist, the bottom most evolution that has its requirements satisfied will have its description
                used for the "Look {item}" command.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Remove Evolution Button</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Removes the corresponding item evolution from the list of evolutions for this item</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Containers Tab</h4>
        <p>The containers tab is used to define containers which can be found in this node.  A container is something that can hold and store items.
        Containers in IF-Space can be configured so that having certain items or a certain number of items in a particular container can trigger
        requirements for other settings in the game (similar to filling the trophy case in Zork).</p>
        <ul>

            </ul>
            <li>Completed Contents Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This field describes what must be stored in the container in order for this container's requirement check to be satisfied.</li>
                <li>This field accepts 1 of 2 types of input:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>A comma separated list of items (E.g. key, cash, note)</li>
                    <li>A number (E.g. 5)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>If a list of items is provided, each of those items must be stored in the container for its requirement check to be satisfied.</li>
                <li>If a number is provided, a minimum of this many items must be stored in the container for its requirement check to be satisfied.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Illegal Items Setting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A comma separated list of items (which exist in the game) that cannot be stored in this container</li>

        <h4>Win Tab</h4>
        <p>The Win Tab is for defining a node as having the potential for winning the game in this node.  If the Win Description is not empty, then it is assumed
        that the node has a win condition.  If there is a win condition and the requirements in the Win Tab are satisified, then the player wins
        the game.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Win Description</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the text that will be printed to the screen during gameplay when the player wins the game.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Lose Tab</h4>
        <p>The Lose Tab is for defining a node as having the potential for losing the game in this node.  If the Lose Description is not empty, then it is assumed
        that the node has a lose condition.  If there is a lose condition and the requirements in the Lose Tab are satisified, then the player loses
        the game.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Requirements Blocks</h4>
        <p>The requirements section exists for many of the features in the IF-Space Engine.  They are a powerful tool for making logical changes
        across these features.  In general, a particular setting or feature that has requirements attached to it will only become available for
        use during gameplay if those reuirements are satisified, otherwise this feature will be absent from the game until those requirements are
        met.</p>
